# BikeSharing
Project #1 for 495R

This project details the final product of a model that predicts the demand for bike rentals on a given day and hour for 2011-2012. the RMD is the model, the output files have my predictions and the test/train/samplesubmission files are from kaggle.com. I mainly used target encoding and just deleted highly correlated variables. then used the log count to actually make predictions. in the end i used an ensemble of lm, svmradial, rf, xgbtree and xgblinear
